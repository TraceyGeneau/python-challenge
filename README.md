# Python Financial Analysis and Election Polling
<br/>

Welcome to the Python challenge repository! üêçüíª This project houses two Python scripts, PyBank and PyPoll, designed to tackle real-world scenarios by harnessing the power of Python programming. In PyBank, we explore financial records, calculating metrics such as total months, net profits/losses, and identifying the greatest increases and decreases in profits. Meanwhile, PyPoll modernizes vote-counting processes, providing insights into total votes, candidate lists, vote percentages, and ultimately determining the election winner.

## Highlights:
<br/>

**PyBank Challenge:** Analyzing financial records and deriving key metrics.

**PyPoll Challenge:** Modernizing vote-counting processes for a town election.
